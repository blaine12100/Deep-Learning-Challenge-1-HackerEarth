This repository Contains the code which I have used for this challenge.
Although it does not have a good accuracy score,it might be helpful for people who are trying to get their feet wet 
with this kind of stuff.

The entire code is in the ipython notebook.

Modify the Location of the Images to the directory of your choice and use it accordingly.

If you find any issues while running this code or have some kind of improvements,flag it as an issue and i will
get back to you.
